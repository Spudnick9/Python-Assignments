
##3.1## Assigned variables and made a equation for hour
sec = 1
min = sec * 60
hour = min * 60
print(hour)

##3.2## Took the answer i got from 3.1 and assigned it to a variable
seconds_per_hour = int(36000)

##3.3 & 3.4## 
seconds_per_day = int(seconds_per_hour) * 24
print(seconds_per_day)

##3.5 made a variable for the answer in float form##
answer1 = float(seconds_per_day)/float(seconds_per_hour)
print(answer1)

##3.6 Made a variable for the answer in integer form##
answer2 = int(seconds_per_day)/int(seconds_per_hour)
print(int(answer2))
